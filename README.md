# C Programming Practice â€“ SDLC Learning

This repository is a hands-on learning space I created to study and practice C programming, using *The C Programming Language* by Kernighan and Ritchie (K&R) as my main reference â€” or pointer ðŸ˜„.

### Background

I began by working through Chapters 1â€“3 of K&R, but found the exercises challenging due to limited prior C experience. So I adjusted my strategy for Chapters 4â€“8:

- Adopted an **SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)** approach.
- Used **Agile-style sprints** to break implementation into manageable steps.
- Leveraged an **LLM** to generate relevant practice problems.
- Created and followed a reusable **README template** for each problem.

This made C more approachable and helped reinforce my understanding through structured practice.

### Repository Layout

Organized by chapter/topic, each folder includes:

- A `.c` file demonstrating a concept.
- A `README.md` file with SDLC breakdown:
  - Requirement
  - Design
  - Implementation (sprints)
  - Testing
  - Deployment
  - Maintenance

This repo marks the first phase of my C journey. I plan to revisit K&R and complete every official exercise in a new repo â€” my own LeetCode-in-C.
