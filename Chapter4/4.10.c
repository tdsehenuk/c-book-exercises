/*Write a recursive function int factorial(int n) that returns the factorial of n.
Test it with factorial(5).*/

//SLDC
// #1 As a user i want to to calculate a factorial of a number through so 
//i can resuse the code in other programss

// #2 have main() function where asks a user printf() to for an int n to
// find the factorial. have function int factorial that takes in one int (n) and 
// returns it.

// #3
// sprint 1: make skeleton and printf -> test
// sprint 2: get user input scanf()
// sprint 3: make factorial func and test answer
// sprint 4
