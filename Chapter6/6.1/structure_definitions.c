This section introduces struct, a user-defined data type in C that allows grouping different data types together. A structure is defined using the struct keyword, followed by the structure's name and its members enclosed in braces.

Problem:
Define a structure named Book that contains:
A string for the title.
A string for the author.
An integer for the publication year.
A float for the price.
Write a program that initializes a Book variable and prints its details.
*/

struct Book {
    char title[50];
    char title[50];
    int publicationYear;
    float price;
};

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // TODO: Implement structure definitions
    return 0;
}
