# 5.10 â€“ Pointers to Functions
## SDLC Documentation and Process

### 1. **Requirement:**
As a programmer, I want to understand how to use function pointers to call functions indirectly. This will allow me to write more flexible code that can decide which function to call at runtime.

---

### 2. **Design:**
The program will:
- Declare functions that perform simple operations (like `add` and `subtract`).
- Declare a **function pointer** that can point to these functions.
- Call the functions using the pointer and pass values to see how the pointer directs execution.

---

### 3. **Implementation:**
- **Sprint 1:** Define two functions (`add` and `subtract`) that take two integer arguments and return an integer result.
- **Sprint 2:** Create a function pointer and assign it to one of the functions.
- **Sprint 3:** Use the function pointer to call the function indirectly, passing it arguments and printing the result.
- **Sprint 4:** Allow the user to choose between `add` and `subtract` via function pointer assignments.

---

### 4. **Testing:**
- Test calling the function via the function pointer.
- Print results to verify that the correct function is being called and that it behaves as expected.

---

### 5. **Deployment:**
This program runs in any C environment, without any additional setup required. To run it locally:
```bash
gcc 5_10_func_pointer.c -o func_pointer_app
./func_pointer_app

### 6. Maintenance:
Function pointers can be extended to work with more complex functions, such as functions with multiple parameters or returning different types.

You can implement a more flexible system where the function pointer can be swapped dynamically based on user input or program logic.
